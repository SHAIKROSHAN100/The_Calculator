**Smart Calculator Web Application**

The **Smart Calculator Web Application** is a full-stack project developed using **React.js, PHP, and MySQL**. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and maintains a history of previous calculations. The frontend, built with React, provides **a dynamic and responsive interface with the feature of voice based calculation,** while the backend (PHP) handles computation logic and database interactions through RESTful APIs. Data such as user calculations and results are securely stored in a **MySQL database** for future reference. This project enhanced my understanding of **React state management, API integration,** and **database connectivity**, while showcasing my ability to design and deploy **interactive, data-driven web applications**.

Developed a **responsive web-based calculator application** using **React.js (frontend), PHP (backend), and MySQL (database)** to perform and store user calculations efficiently. The project demonstrates seamless frontend-backend integration, data persistence, and real-time computation features with a cean, iterative UI.

Key Features : 
1. <b>Basic & Advanced Calculations</b> : Supports arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with additional functionality like voice based, history and clear options. 
2. **Calculation History** : User operations and results are stored in MySQL, allowing users to review past calculations.
3. **Dynamic UI Updates**: Real-time result rendering using React hooks and state management.
4. **Backend Integration**: Used PHP APIs to handle computation logic and database communication securely.
5. **Responsive Design**: Built with React and CSS for compatibility across desktops and mobile devices.
6. **CRUD Operations**: Implemented basic database interactions to insert, view, and delete calculation records.

Technologies Used : 
1. **Frontend** : React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES6)
2. **Backend** : PHP (REST API)
3. **Database** : MySQL
4. **Tools** : VS Code, Git

Outcome/Impact:
1. Enhanced Understanding of **React component-based architecture** and **state management.**
2. Strengthened **API integration** and **database connectivity** skills.
3. Improved application security and performance through **optimized PHP queries.**
