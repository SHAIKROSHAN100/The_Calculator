**The Smart Calculator Web Application**

The **Smart Calculator Web Application** is a full-stack project developed using **React.js, PHP, and MySQL**. The application allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations and maintains a history of previous calculations. The frontend, built with React, provides **a dynamic and responsive interface with the feature of voice based calculation,** while the backend (PHP) handles computation logic and database interactions through RESTful APIs. Data such as user calculations and results are securely stored in a **MySQL database** for future reference. This project enhanced my understanding of **React state management, API integration,** and **database connectivity**, while showcasing my ability to design and deploy **interactive, data-driven web applications**.

**Key Features :** 
1. <b>Basic & Advanced Calculations</b> : Supports arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with additional functionality like voice based, history and clear options. 
2. **Calculation History** : User operations and results are stored in MySQL, allowing users to review past calculations.
3. **Dynamic UI Updates**: Real-time result rendering using React hooks and state management.
4. **Backend Integration**: Used PHP APIs to handle computation logic and database communication securely.
5. **Responsive Design**: Built with React and CSS for compatibility across desktops and mobile devices.
6. **CRUD Operations**: Implemented basic database interactions to insert, view, and delete calculation records.

**Technologies Used : **
1. **Frontend** : React.js, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript(ES6)
2. **Backend** : PHP (REST API)
3. **Database** : MySQL
4. **Tools** : VS Code, Git

**Outcome/Impact:**
1. Enhanced Understanding of **React component-based architecture** and **state management.**
2. Strengthened **API integration** and **database connectivity** skills.
3. Improved application security and performance through **optimized PHP queries.**

**How to use the Smart Calculator Web Application**
1. Download the files.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Keep the calcapi.php and database.php in the folder and place them in the php environment. Modify the mysql databases and connect it with php.
4. Run the App.js file with npm run dev.
5. To use your voice for the calculation :
   Enable the feature by clicking on the microphone icon, and <br>
   use the commands : <br>
   Say : numbers <br>
   Say : "plus" for + sign , "minus" for - sign, "into" for "*", "divide" for "/" <br>
   Say : "remove" for clear <br>
   Say : "remove all" for all clear <br>
   Say : "result" to store the result of the calculation <br>
6. For typing purposes in pc click on the black box on the top. For multiplication use 'x' letter.<br>
