Smart Calculator Web Application

Developed a responsive web-based calculator application using React.js (frontend), PHP (backend), and MySQL (database) to perform and store user calculations efficiently. The project demonstrates seamless frontend-backend integration, data persistence, and real-time computation features with a cean, iterative UI.

Key Features : 
1. <b>Basic & Advanced Calculations</b> : Supports arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with additional functionality like voice based, history and clear options. 
2. **Calculation History** : User operations and results are stored in MySQL, allowing users to review past calculations.
3. **Dynamic UI Updates**: Real-time result rendering using React hooks and state management.
4. **Backend Integration**: Used PHP APIs to handle computation logic and database communication securely.
5. **Responsive Design**: Built with React and CSS for compatibility across desktops and mobile devices.
6. **CRUD Operations**: Implemented basic database interactions to insert, view, and delete calculation records.
